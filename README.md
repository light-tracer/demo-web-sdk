# Light Tracer Render demo web SDK

Create photo-real interactive 3D visuals right inside the web browser https://lighttracer.org/web.html

Light Tracer Render is a **client-side** rendering solution. This means that rendering occurs on the **user's machine**, and the rendering speed depends on the specific GPU installed.

[**See what's new**](CHANGELOG.md) (**28-Nov-2023** exposed more LT abilities with JS API)

## Getting started

To run samples locally launch any web server in SDK directory e.g. `python3 -m http.server 8000` then navigate to http://localhost:8000/samples/ in the web browser.
